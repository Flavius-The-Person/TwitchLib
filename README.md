This is a fork of the above linked Repository.

## Goals
I am moving this from a static typed library with dependencies on RestNet to a library that uses generics and a proper control structure.

## Acknowledgements
[Pwnoz0r](https://github.com/pwnoz0r), the original author, is a buddy of mine. I just want to make it better for him and for everyone :)

## Nota Bene
Though this compiles, it likely does not work.

## TODO
Write the controller that manages access to the data.
