# [TwitchLib](https://github.com/Pwnoz0r/TwitchLib)
This is a fork of the above linked Repository.

## Goals
I am moving this from a static typed library with dependencies on RestNet to a library that uses generics and a proper control structure.

## Acknowledgements
[Pwnoz0r](https://github.com/pwnoz0r) is a buddy of mine, and I helped him some while he was developing this library. I just want to make it better, for him and for everyone :)

## Nota Bene
This will currently not compile/work. It is a work in progress.
